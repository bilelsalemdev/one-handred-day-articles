# Advanced SQL: Mastering Query Optimization and Complex Joins

Hello everyone, السلام عليكم و رحمة الله و بركاته

SQL (Structured Query Language) is an essential tool for managing and manipulating relational databases. While basic SQL skills can get you started, advanced SQL techniques can greatly enhance your ability to handle complex queries and optimize database performance. This article delves into advanced SQL topics, focusing on sophisticated query optimization strategies, advanced join types, and the intricacies of `SELECT` statements.

### Advanced Query Optimization Techniques

Optimizing SQL queries is a critical skill for database administrators and developers. Advanced query optimization goes beyond basic indexing and query refactoring to include a range of sophisticated techniques.

#### 1. Query Execution Plans

Understanding the execution plan of a query is crucial for optimization. The execution plan shows how the SQL engine executes a query, revealing potential bottlenecks.

- **EXPLAIN**: The `EXPLAIN` statement provides insights into how a query will be executed, allowing you to identify inefficiencies.

  ```sql
  EXPLAIN SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```

- **ANALYZE**: The `ANALYZE` statement, used in conjunction with `EXPLAIN`, executes the query and provides runtime statistics, offering a deeper understanding of the query performance.
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  ```

#### 2. Subquery Optimization

Subqueries can sometimes be replaced with more efficient joins or with the `WITH` clause (Common Table Expressions).

- **Replacing Subqueries with Joins**:

  ```sql
  -- Subquery
  SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column1 FROM table2);

  -- Equivalent Join
  SELECT table1.* FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.column1 = table2.column1;
  ```

- **Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**:
  ```sql
  WITH CTE AS (
      SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition
  )
  SELECT * FROM CTE WHERE another_condition;
  ```

#### 3. Indexing Strategies

Advanced indexing strategies include using composite indexes and covering indexes.

- **Composite Index**: Indexes that include multiple columns can speed up queries that filter on those columns.

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_composite ON table_name (column1, column2);
  ```

- **Covering Index**: An index that includes all the columns retrieved by the query can significantly improve performance.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON table_name (column1, column2, column3);
  ```

#### 4. Partitioning

Partitioning a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces can improve query performance by limiting the amount of data scanned.

- **Range Partitioning**:

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT,
      order_date DATE,
      ...
  ) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date) (
      PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN ('2024-01-01'),
      PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('2025-01-01'),
      ...
  );
  ```

- **Hash Partitioning**: Distributes data across a specified number of partitions based on a hash function, providing uniform distribution.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE users (
      user_id INT,
      username VARCHAR(255),
      ...
  ) PARTITION BY HASH(user_id) PARTITIONS 4;
  ```

- **List Partitioning**: Divides data into partitions based on a list of values.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE sales (
      sale_id INT,
      region VARCHAR(255),
      ...
  ) PARTITION BY LIST (region) (
      PARTITION p0 VALUES IN ('North', 'South'),
      PARTITION p1 VALUES IN ('East', 'West')
  );
  ```

#### 5. Materialized Views

Materialized views store the result of a query physically and can be refreshed periodically, improving performance for complex queries that are executed frequently.

- **Creating a Materialized View**:

  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
  SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY region;
  ```

- **Refreshing a Materialized View**:
  ```sql
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
  ```

## Note:

In MySQL, views exist, but materialized views do not exist natively. MySQL supports standard views, which are virtual tables that store the query definition and generate the result set dynamically when queried. However, it does not have built-in support for materialized views, which store the result set physically.

### Views in MySQL

#### Creating a View

You can create a view in MySQL using the `CREATE VIEW` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE VIEW ActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

This creates a view named `ActiveCustomers` that includes only active customers from the `Customers` table. Querying this view looks like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM ActiveCustomers;
```

#### Updating a View

Views can be updated with the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Status = 'Active' AND Country = 'USA';
```

This modifies the `ActiveCustomers` view to include only active customers from the USA.

#### Dropping a View

You can remove a view with the `DROP VIEW` statement:

```sql
DROP VIEW ActiveCustomers;
```

#### Materialized Views in MySQL

MySQL does not support materialized views natively, but there are workarounds to achieve similar functionality. Here are a couple of methods:

##### 1. Using a Table and Scheduled Updates

One common approach is to create a table that stores the results of the query and update it periodically using scheduled events (cron jobs) or triggers.

##### Creating the Table

First, create a table to store the results:

```sql
CREATE TABLE MaterializedActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

##### Updating the Table

Use a scheduled event to update the table periodically. This example uses a MySQL event to update the table every hour:

```sql
CREATE EVENT UpdateMaterializedActiveCustomers
ON SCHEDULE EVERY 1 HOUR
DO
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM MaterializedActiveCustomers;
    INSERT INTO MaterializedActiveCustomers
    SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country
    FROM Customers
    WHERE Status = 'Active';
END;
```

This event clears and repopulates the `MaterializedActiveCustomers` table every hour with the latest active customers.

##### 2. Using Triggers

Another approach is to use triggers to keep the table in sync with the base tables. However, this can become complex and may not be as efficient for large datasets.

#### Example of Using Triggers

##### Creating the Table

First, create the table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE MaterializedActiveCustomers AS
SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country
FROM Customers
WHERE Status = 'Active';
```

##### Creating Triggers

Create triggers to keep the materialized table updated:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE TRIGGER after_customer_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.Status = 'Active' THEN
        INSERT INTO MaterializedActiveCustomers (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country)
        VALUES (NEW.CustomerID, NEW.CustomerName, NEW.ContactName, NEW.Country);
    END IF;
END //

CREATE TRIGGER after_customer_update
AFTER UPDATE ON Customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF OLD.Status = 'Active' AND NEW.Status != 'Active' THEN
        DELETE FROM MaterializedActiveCustomers WHERE CustomerID = OLD.CustomerID;
    ELSEIF NEW.Status = 'Active' THEN
        REPLACE INTO MaterializedActiveCustomers (CustomerID, CustomerName, ContactName, Country)
        VALUES (NEW.CustomerID, NEW.CustomerName, NEW.ContactName, NEW.Country);
    END IF;
END //

CREATE TRIGGER after_customer_delete
AFTER DELETE ON Customers
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM MaterializedActiveCustomers WHERE CustomerID = OLD.CustomerID;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

These triggers will ensure that the `MaterializedActiveCustomers` table stays updated with changes to the `Customers` table.

#### Conclusion

While MySQL supports views, it does not have native support for materialized views. However, you can achieve similar functionality using tables with scheduled updates or triggers. By using these workarounds, you can maintain precomputed results that can be queried quickly, similar to materialized views in other database systems.

### Advanced Join Types and Techniques

Joins are fundamental to SQL, allowing you to combine data from multiple tables. Beyond basic joins, advanced join techniques can handle more complex requirements.

#### 1. Self Joins

A self join is a regular join but the table is joined with itself. It is useful for comparing rows within the same table.

```sql
SELECT a.employee_id, a.name, b.name AS manager_name
FROM employees a
INNER JOIN employees b ON a.manager_id = b.employee_id;
```

#### 2. Lateral Joins

The `LATERAL` join allows subqueries to reference columns from preceding tables in the `FROM` clause. This is useful for more complex queries.

```sql
SELECT a.*, b.*
FROM table1 a
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT *
    FROM table2 b
    WHERE b.column1 = a.column1
    ORDER BY b.column2 DESC
    LIMIT 1
) b ON TRUE;
```

#### 3. Full Outer Joins with COALESCE

Handling cases where you need a full outer join but want to avoid `NULL` values in the result.

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(a.column1, b.column1) AS column1, a.column2, b.column2
FROM table1 a
FULL OUTER JOIN table2 b ON a.column1 = b.column1;
```

#### 4. Advanced Join Filters

Applying complex conditions in joins to filter results more precisely.

```sql
SELECT a.column1, b.column2
FROM table1 a
INNER JOIN table2 b ON a.column1 = b.column1 AND a.date_column BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';
```

#### 5. Anti Joins and Semi Joins

These joins are useful for exclusion and inclusion queries respectively.

- **Anti Join**: Retrieves rows from the left table that do not have a matching row in the right table.

  ```sql
  SELECT a.*
  FROM table1 a
  LEFT JOIN table2 b ON a.column1 = b.column1
  WHERE b.column1 IS NULL;
  ```

- **Semi Join**: Retrieves rows from the left table where one or more matches exist in the right table.
  ```sql
  SELECT a.*
  FROM table1 a
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table2 b WHERE a.column1 = b.column1);
  ```

### Advanced `SELECT` Statements

The `SELECT` statement can be extended with advanced features to meet complex data retrieval requirements.

#### 1. Window Functions

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, providing powerful analytics capabilities.

- **Row Number**:

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS row_num
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Running Total**:

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, SUM(column2) OVER (ORDER BY column1) AS running_total
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Ranking**:

  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2) AS rank
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Moving Average**:
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, AVG(column2) OVER (PARTITION BY column1 ORDER BY column2 ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING) AS moving_avg
  FROM table_name;
  ```

#### 2. Recursive CTEs

Recursive CTEs allow you to perform recursive queries, useful for hierarchical data.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cte AS (
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    UNION ALL
    SELECT t.column1, t.column2
    FROM table_name t
    INNER JOIN cte ON t.column1 = cte.column1
)
SELECT * FROM cte;
```

#### 3. JSON Functions

Modern SQL databases often include functions to handle JSON data, enabling you to store and query JSON documents.

- **Extracting JSON Values**:

  ```sql
  SELECT json_column->>'key' AS value
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Aggregating into JSON**:

  ```sql
  SELECT json_agg(row_to_json(t))
  FROM (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name) t;
  ```

- **Updating JSON Data**:
  ```sql
  UPDATE table_name
  SET json_column = jsonb_set(json_column, '{key}', '"new_value"', true)
  WHERE condition;
  ```

#### 4. Pivoting Data

Pivoting transforms rows into columns, providing a way to reorganize and summarize data for reporting purposes.

- **Using CASE Statements for Pivoting**:
  ```sql
  SELECT
      category,
      SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2021 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2021,
      SUM(CASE WHEN year = 2022 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_2022
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY category;
  ```

#### 5. Dynamic SQL

Dynamic SQL allows for the construction and execution of SQL statements at runtime, providing flexibility for complex queries that need to be generated dynamically.

- **Executing Dynamic SQL**:

  ```sql


  EXECUTE 'SELECT * FROM ' || table_name || ' WHERE ' || condition;
  ```

- **Using Prepared Statements**:
  ```sql
  PREPARE stmt AS SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column1 = $1;
  EXECUTE stmt('value');
  ```
